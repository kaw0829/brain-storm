# Brain-Storm

An educational game created with React. Redux ToolKit was used to implement state management. Firebase realtime database was used to store user hi-scores.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The goal of this project was primarily to get more familiar with the new Redux Toolkit. There are of course much better ways to implement a game but this was a learning project. Brain-Storm took approximately 40 to 60 hours and is orgainized in a "DUCKS" pattern as recommended by the Redux documentation as of 2021.

## TODO

Add multiplayer support and refactor the store slices. Much of the game information is stored in redux and could be moved into firebase to allow for multiplayer functionality.

## What I Learned

### This project keep changing as I worked on it and was large enough that it would have benefited from a more formal planning phase.

### Using a testing framework from the beginning would have aided speed of development, Jest could have been used for unit testing as it works well with React. Cypress would have been helpful for component testing. Testing was not implemented because the project was intially much smaller in scope.
